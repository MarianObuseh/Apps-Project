# Apps Project
In this project, I analyzed data about the Apple Store and Google Play Store apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets. <br/>
I concluded that developing a practical app that incorporates certain level of fun could potentially lead to more revenue for the company from both Stores. For example, an app that prepares people for job or grad school interviews with a very humorous intelligent assistant that tries to mimic Trevor Noah's voice and satirically has a response for every question answered - correctly or otherwise. The app would also have other people studying for different categories of interviews interacting with you through Knowledge Sharing Sessions, discussion forums, daily sarcastic quotes reminding users to visit the app etc. <br/>
While I acknowledge that there can be no absolute correct recommendation, I believe exploring my recommendation might be worthwhile for the hypothetical company. <br/>
