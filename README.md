# Apps Project

In this project, I pretend to be an incipient Data Analyst working for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps in English. These apps are then made available on Google Play Store and the iOS App Store. We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue is in-app ads. This means the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. 

My goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps would most likely attract more users on both Google Play Store and the iOS App Store. 

I concluded that developing a practical app that incorporates certain level of fun could potentially lead to more revenue for the company from both Stores. For example, an app that prepares people for job or grad school interviews with a very humorous intelligent assistant that tries to mimic Trevor Noah's voice and satirically has a response for every question answered - correctly or otherwise. The app would also have other people studying for different categories of interviews interacting with you through Knowledge Sharing Sessions, discussion forums, daily sarcastic quotes reminding users to visit the app etc. <br/>

While I acknowledge that there can be no absolute correct recommendation, I believe exploring my recommendation might be worthwhile for the hypothetical company. <br/>

It was meant to be particularly challenging for the nascent data analyst
